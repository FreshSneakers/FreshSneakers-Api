        description:'If you thought patent leather was reserved only for the Air Jordan 11, you havent met the Air Jordan 1 Retro Black Gold Patent from 2013. With a completely patent leather upper, the glossy finish accentuated the gold details on this AJ1 like the Swoosh, Wings logo, and Nike Air patch on the tongue. Some of the best additions to this Air Jordan 1 Retro are the translucent gum outsole with gold speckles and the gold stitching along the midsole. This 2013 Air Jordan 1 Retro Black Gold Patent was a rework of an Air Jordan 1 Mid that released in 2003 as part of the Patent Pack. That Air Jordan 1 has less gold, a black midsole and outsole, and was the last Air Jordan 1 Retro to come with a Jumpman keychain. An old rumor has it that a pair of the 2003 original once fetched $30,000 on eBay. This Air Jordan 1 Retro Black Gold Patent debuted in April of 2013 as a limited release in a year that saw over 25 Air Jordan 1s in low, mid, and high form hit retail shelves. With its premium make up and low production numbers, the Air Jordan 1 Retro Black Gold Patent stood out from the crowd that year',
